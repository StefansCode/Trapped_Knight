# Trapped_Knight
I implemeted the problem form the following video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGQe8waGJ4w.

This program calculates the final position and number of iterations for each knight with the movement (x,y) where x,y < 100, instead of just (1,2) as shown in the video.

I still have some ideas for optimization and generalization, which I might add later.
